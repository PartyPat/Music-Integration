Music Integration Extension
Integrate your music with the Gnome Shell.

This extension listens to Dbus MPRIS and automatically looks for players.
It automatically adds an icon to the Gnome panel when it finds a music player; you have access to basic controls there.
It will also notify you when the song changes, and you can also control the player through the notifications and message tray.

This extension is a fork of Jean-Philippe Braun's extension (eon@patapon.info)
